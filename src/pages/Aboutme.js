          <p> I am a United States Army Veteran with a background of operating various types of motorized aparatuses such as: Bulldozers, Excavator, Compactor, Front-Loader, Backhoe, Dump-Truck etc. For 7 years I have been committed to that profesion, until I decided it was time to make  a drastic change to seek out better oppurtunities. That oppurtunity started with LEARN Academy... <br/><br/> <a href="https://www.learnacademy.org/"> @LEARN Academy</a>, I aquired the skills needed to be software engineer. As a Graduate I continue to practice the fundamentals of web developing and specialize in: Javascript, ReactJS, Ruby, Postgres and Ruby On Rails. </p>
